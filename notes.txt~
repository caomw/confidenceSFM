Why do we have the checks for the Screen resolution?

ToDo

- Combine task with eye tracker. Need to test it. ok

- Ask for the subject Name ID. ok
- Program the different sessions. Program the different conditions into a trial structure for the current experiment. ok
- Randomize the order of presentation of the blocks.
- Change the code (leopold 2006). Get responses continuously and make responses continuous. To check
- Define better the triggers we are going to use.
- Program the response screens for subjects now that it is continuous. ok
- Save all responses and data into one single file.
- check that we are saving all data to disk and to the eyelink
- check the calibration commands in case the subject moves his/her head.


Check 'scrFreq'

Changed from the old psychtoolbox to the new version using textures. Indeed, we shouldn't 
even use textures as for dots they are not needed anymore (simply use 'DrawDots').ok
