Why do we have the checks for the Screen resolution?

ToDo

Combine task with eye tracker (see runConf1k_SFM_new.m). ok. Need to test it.
Change the code (leopold 2006). Get responses continuously and make responses continuous. (ok)

Program the different conditions into a trial structure for the current experiment

Program the response screens for subjects now that it is continuous

Check 'scrFreq'

Changed from the old psychtoolbox to the new version using textures. Indeed, we shouldn't 
even use textures as for dots they are not needed anymore (simply use 'DrawDots').ok
